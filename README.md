Digital Product Management Web Form

Description of Project: I made a web form survey using the code we learned inn class. My survey is about user's spring break plans. 

How my web form conforms to best practices: 

I made my web form flow from easiest to hardest, as well as easiest to more specific in order to reduce friction in the survey. I also grouped contact info on one page of the form and saved the open-ended questions for the second page of the form. Another best practice was breaking the form into multiple pages, as well as adding a progress indicator so users have a clear idea of how much is left.
